<h1>Workshop Scope and Goals</h1>
<div id="description">

  <p>The current computing landscape has gone through an ever-increasing rate of change and innovation. This change has been driven by the relentless need to improve the energy-efficient, memory, and compute throughput at all levels of the architectural hierarchy. Although the amount of data that must be organized by today's systems posed new challenges to the architecture, which can no longer be solved with classical, homogeneous design. Improvements in all those areas have led Heterogeneous systems to become the norm rather than the exception.</p>

  <p>Heterogeneous computing leverages a diverse set of computing (CPU, GPU, FPGA, TPU, DPU, etc.) and Memory (HBM, Persistent Memory, Coherent PCI protocols, etc.), hierarchical systems and units to accelerate the execution of a diverse set of applications. Emerging and existing areas such as AI, BigData, Cloud Computing, Edge-Computing, Real-time systems, High-Performance Computing, and others have seen a real benefit due to Heterogenous computer architectures. In addition, a new wave of accelerators based on dataflow architecture instead of the traditional von Neumann is sure to bring additional challenges and opportunities.</p>

  <p>These new heterogeneous architectures often also require the development of new applications and programming models, to satisfy these new architectures and to fully utilize these capacities. This workshop focuses on understanding the implications of heterogeneous designs at all levels of the computing system stack, such as hardware, compiler optimizations, porting of applications, and developing programming environments for current and emerging systems in all the above-mentioned areas. It seeks to ground heterogeneous system design research through studies of application kernels and/or whole applications, as well as shed light on new tools, libraries and runtime systems that improve the performance and productivity of applications on heterogeneous systems.</p>

  <p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners who are at the forefront of Heterogeneous computing to learn the opportunities and challenges in future Heterogeneous system design trends and thus help influence the next trends in this area.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Applications for hybrid/heterogenous systems;</li>
