    "In this keynote, I argue that our pursuit of Performance, Portability, and Productivity has led us into a trap. We
    often treat these goals as equally important and equally attainable at all times — but in practice, this assumption
    rarely holds. Drawing from recent work in compilers and system software — including kernel-level replay, JIT
    compilation, and ML-guided runtime systems — I make the case for a re-evaluation of priorities."

    <h4><b>Bio:</b>
    Konstantinos Parasyris is a Computer Scientist at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). His research focuses on programming languages, compilers, and performance engineering for heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. He is the involved in several research projects such as Mneme, a record-replay framework for GPU kernel autotuning, Proteus, a just-in-time optimization system for GPU performance and the AMS (Autonomous Multi-Scale Simulation) surrogate model framework. His work has been published at top venues including SC, PACT, CGO, PPoPP, TACO and TPDS. Konstantinos has served on the program committees of SC, IPDPS, EuroMPI, and was a member of the review board for IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Thessaly, Greece, and actively organizes workshops such as LLPP, ESwML, and AI4Dev.
